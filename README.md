Advanced Polyp Segmentation Using U-Net
Overview
This project focuses on developing an advanced polyp segmentation model using the U-Net architecture. The model aids in the early diagnosis and treatment planning of colorectal cancer by accurately identifying and outlining the boundaries of polyps in medical images.

Dataset
The project utilizes the Kvasir-SEG dataset, provided by Simula Research Laboratory and SimulaMet. This dataset was presented at the 26th International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling (MMM 2020) and is specifically designed for polyp segmentation tasks.

Preprocessing
To prepare the data for model training, the following preprocessing steps were implemented:

Rescaling: Pixel values were normalized to a range of 0-1 by dividing each value by 255, ensuring uniform data representation.
Resizing: All images and their corresponding masks were resized to dimensions of 256x256 pixels, providing a consistent input size for the model.
Data Augmentation
To improve the model's ability to generalize across different conditions and orientations of polyps, various augmentation techniques were employed:

Horizontal and vertical flipping
Rotation
Zooming
Brightness adjustments
These augmentations simulate real-world variations, enhancing the diversity of the training data.

Model Architecture
The U-Net architecture, originally introduced at the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2015) conference, was used for this project. U-Net is well-regarded for its efficiency in biomedical image segmentation and has been widely adopted for various image analysis tasks beyond medical imaging.

Results
The model demonstrated high accuracy in segmenting polyps, underscoring the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in medical imaging. This solution contributes to better diagnostic and treatment planning processes, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes.
